<h3>Review results from last run {{ date }}</h3>
<p>Here you can review the results from the last run of the checklist. Checks are not always perfectly correct in their procedure and result. You can keep a check from running by clicking the 'Skip' link beside it. You can run the checklist again by expanding the fieldset above.</p>
<table class="security-review-run-and-review__table">
    <tbody>
    {% for check in checks %}
        <tr class="security-review-run-and-review__entry {{ check.result_string }}">
            <td>{{ check.message }}</td>
            <td>{{ check.help_link }}</td>
            <td>{{ check.toggle_link }}</td>
